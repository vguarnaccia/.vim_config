==========================
The FOSS Vim Configuration
==========================

Finally, a vim configuration designed for poking around open source projects. This config is designed to be language agnostic, but like its creator, it centers around git, Python, C/C++/C#.

Kiding aside, I started using vim in just after graduation in June of 2016, so this config is far from perfect.

Installation
============

To install, simply run the following two commands::

  git clone https://github.com/vguarnaccia/vim_config.git
  sh ~/.vim_config/install.sh
  
Requirements
============

Vim, obviously, and compiled with python. More requirements to come in the future.
